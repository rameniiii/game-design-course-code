    "# Activity 1.4 - Escape the Island Free Design\n",
    "\n",
    "This morning we learned all about Classes and Methods, and used them to build a very crude *Escape the Island* adventure game. I'm sure you have tons of ideas about how to make the game better, so now you'll get your chance to add whatever you want! But first, there's a few issues with the current code that need fixing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It doesn't error check entries! Add a way to make sure the code doesn't break when someone enters something unexpected...\n",
    "1. If we run out of encounters, we can't find any more loot... Change the code so we can continue to find food and water even after we've found all the other items at the tile (perhaps adding a random chance to find food and water at any tile, the probability of which you can customize).\n",
    "1. There is currently no way to win the game!! Add a win condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, once you've fixed the above issues, feel free to extend the game in any way you like! Here's a few ideas to get you started:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improve the map: The Island Grid has 16 spaces. You could design 16 unique tiles for each of those spaces. Don't forget to include new dangers!\n",
    "1. Improved encounters: Maybe you want the game to be more interesting than static encounters. Perhaps you can make an Encounter class, that let's you do things in encounters like fight, flee, or explore (these sound like methods for the encounter)\n",
    "1. Improved items: Maybe certain items help you survive the island. Maybe if you find a specific combination of items you win the game and escape the island?\n",
    "1. Improved world: Add a story to the island that you discover as you explore. Perhaps you could include a 'survivor's journal' that you could copy this story into as you find it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you come up with any other ideas on your own, feel free to implement them! In fact, we could even combine everyone's ideas together at the end to make an awesome game with all of these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## We need a game controller...\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for this to work, we will need a loop to play our game. I've included a loop here that should work with the solution from today's lesson. We'll need to use our classes from today as well, so I've pasted them here, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes and Tiles from the morning lesson."
